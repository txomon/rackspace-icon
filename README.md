About this
==========

Got in touch with Rackspace and they linked me to http://www.rackspace.com/blog/newsroom/logos-2/,
I have refurbished the logo a little to be in SVG and just have the logo and the name, mainly to 
be cleaner on a presentation.

License
=======

I have no idea which license should this have, as I have converted the logo to SVG and hacked
it a little.
